  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I’m a new grad machine learning engineer with a specialty for computer vision applications.</p>
  
  <h1>Who I am</h1>
  <p>“The simplest solution is often the right one” – Occam’s Razor
Whether it’s building software, leading teams, or wrenching my motorbike, I engineer solutions that are robust and built to last. I believe in the power of simple solutions, thinking before acting, and always taking the middle path. Like the wise Bruce Lee says, “It is not about daily increase - but daily decrease - hack away the unessential” 
</p>
  
  <h1>What I’m about</h1>
  <p>Space exploration. Self-driving cars. Your front facing camera. What do these all have in common? They all rely on hard, data-driven computer vision AI. This fall I’m going to graduate with a degree in Computer Science with a specialty in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford, and with my background in LIDAR sensing and computer vision research, I plan to take my skills and apply them to that junction. 
Why? The era of hand-driven capsules recedes to black-and-white memory and machines guide our launching-and-landing rockets; the importance of precise, immaculate computer vision models and artificial intelligence is more crucial now than ever. I want to be there for that.
